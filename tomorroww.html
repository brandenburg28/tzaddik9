    <p>What can we know about life elsewhere in the Universe ?
      <br>
      <br>
      Limits of our perception, ability to know and imagination
      <br>
      <br>
      Must life out-there be humanlike? What could be the motivation for extra-terrestrials ?…their needs, value and their sense for ethics ?
      <br>
      <br>
      Alien sensory system-modes of understanding —languages-communication– their motivators and what is their notion of the meaning and way of life. Can we expect to have anything in common with the Usul people that inhabit the Nurul star-cluster?
      <br>
      <br>
      Other weird alien stuff-postulating unimaginable stuff about aliens-within the bounds of human perception – reason – understanding – imagination
      <br>
      <br>
      Is the Universe a designed field of production? , which would suggest a –plan > planner> production instrument (Universe) and a desired end-product, foreseen, and maybe not yet realized, cause currently still out of the grasp of our capacity of reason.
      
      Could certain regions of the Universe be underpinned and structured by different constellations of archetypes than the body of archetypes, that our region has as an all-determining matrix underneath? Ruling our cosmic local environment and our physiology/psychology.? That means that we can only imagine life within the given archetypal forms and thus boundaries of our existence.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the same static and dynamic group of archetypes that underpin our (physical-biological-psycho-spiritual) reality is constellated elsewhere in the Universe in the same manner–then one can expect the existence of humans like us. Same psychology-subject to same innate drives, and a similar natural biological and geophysical environment corresponding to it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Far far away in the Universe–in the future–Year 27220
      
      We know that we became the conscious humans we are today. We also know that we still have to become much more conscious-aware individuals. We developed from being group people -guided and living by instinct and intuition (‘how to do and navigate life’-a knowledge, that is given by nature). Now our personal progress and further evolution is dependant on paying attention to and taking into the natural creative factors -the archetypes- that are present and active within the unconscious of the collective and each individual
      
      New archetypes will rise in the future and will have their profound effect on us.
      
      Can we fathom what our psychological and spiritual life will be —-25000 years ahead? We will not have changed much biologically, because that’s very much determined to our natural environment.
      
      Does the creating Universe have other desired goals in ‘mind’ and seeks these to be realized with aid of other aliens -not similar like us ,within it?
      
      Is it reasonable to assume that the Spirit within its field of creation-the Universe- seeks only the creation of conscious awareness (through us)? Or are there elsewhere (other) archetypes active in different constellations -producing other new attributions to the creative Divine. New creations – creatures – abilities, which are beyond our imagination, out of reach of our perception and reason —and that are totally alien to our nature? If so–then the physicality of these life forms and the evolutionary environment must be very different from ours.
      <br>
      <br>
      
      Could it be that we and our ability of conscious awareness, even including knowledge of the Spirit itself, be the main (and only ?) goal of life elsewhere in the Universe? Then….
      
      Then He brought Abraham outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.” Genesis 15:5
      
      Modesty guarantees an open and inquisitive mind.
      
      We can empirically know that the creating spirit is One and a multiplicity at the same time. This is shown by the interconnectedness of life in external nature and the activity within the unconscious part of our psyche shows. Who is the CEO in all this keeping the parts together or not, within One whole?
      
      [ In development ….
      
      Archetypes as universal structural elements;-Matter – life — living matter, materialized life–— ((Did life take matter, did matter create life. Is life energy that through matter took a material form? or is it a chunk of matter that brought itself to life?—))–Archetypes–Substance–Life Matter vv–any arch form any where–creating other forms
      
      Why was the Universe created–came into existence ?
      Why can’t people see God?, somebody asked an old Rebbe.
      
      His answer: ‘Because people don’t bow deep enough.‘

        <img src="/assets/budha.jpg" class="img-fluit p-2" alt="budha" width="500vh">Tomorrows people know that they are subject to nature’s will that seeks them to become conscious-aware mature individuals, and them to respect and realize this will to ability they can. They know it is their duty to Nature or God to obey their inborn natural drive to individuate.
<br>
<br>
Therefore one can expect that tomorrows societies shall are shaped by people who perceive their duty to individuate as the highest value and the primary meaning of their life. Their society will not consist of ‘individualists’ –meaning each person pursuing their ego-centric driven wants and wishes. They will put first nature’s will to become fully human, the well-being of their fellow beings and their societies’ social quality. And will be good guardians of the natural world.
<br>
<br>
They will create a – global – society to serve the natural goal of becoming conscious-aware individuals, which will be considered a personal and collective social duty. And, therefore live life and organize their living environment, including their society, according to this goal. 

They are people who have a strong love for nature, for life and the good aspects of human nature. And considering themselves not to be perfect humans, they will continuously make an effort to develop themselves to the best of their ability and will try to make individuals out of ‘one piece’ of themselves.
They will see this as their duty to the spirit of nature (or God) and their fellow human beings, including the next generations. Their sense of value and dignity depend on this effort.
<br>
<br>
Tomorrow’s people will be very aware of the catastrophic consequences that will result from not taking into consideration and paying attention to their inborn natural drive to individuate.
<br>
<br>
They know they do not stand a chance against nature’s evolutionary power, a power which now demands psychic fitness as well. But it will not only be fear for destruction and moral decay as result of resisting the will of nature (The instinct to individuate) that will motivate these people to strive for change and maintain the world for the better, and keep it that way.

It is mostly their sense for the good -beauty -truth and love for life, others and general humanness that will drive them to bring the best out of themselves, improve their living environment and to be excellent guardians of the world.

Their love for the good aspect of the human being, of human nature, is expressed in worrying about and care for others and in their effort to seek knowledge and develop wisdom to make the best choices in the interest for their society and their fellow man.

They will organize the global society – as an aid serving the individuation of the individual (nature’s will to become fully human), and to develop their full potential and will consider this endeavor a human right and a social duty to others, including the next generations.

They will protect the well-being of humans and their rights and the natural world fiercely. The world of nature shall be considered an essential mean for education and as such will be protected by all means.

Self-development, life-long education and care for the biological world and the maintenance of flora, fauna, and oceans – will become the largest employer. More of this under–image of the future– on the homepage

Destructive people, leaders and human right abusers will have no chance against these fully mature, superior and to higher humanness directed people.
<br>
<br>
We can look forward to a positive future, but we also have a lot of work ahead. Beginning with each person’s duty of self-development to ability that they can. 
<br>
<br>

Because the evolution of the human being -through an innate psychic creative process- drives us towards becoming more fully and truly human (with our attention and effort) it inevitable will create a better world. Therefore …. we may cautiously optimistically add:
